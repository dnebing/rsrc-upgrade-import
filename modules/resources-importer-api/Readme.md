# resources-importer-api

The default Liferay bundle does not expose the Resources Importer APIs
externally.

This bundle exposes those APIs (through a hacky copy of relevant code)
and adds some utility classes to support invoking RI APIs from
your code.

It also includes the base classes I used for building an Upgrade Process-based
RI solution.
